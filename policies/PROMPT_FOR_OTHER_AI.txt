Generate a single JavaScript file for Go Fish policy.

Requirements:
1) Output only valid JavaScript code.
2) Define function:
   pickMove(state, legalActions, playerIndex)
3) Return exactly one legal action object from legalActions:
   { type: "ask_rank", rank: "A|2|...|K" }
4) Never return invalid ranks.
5) If uncertain, return legalActions[0].
6) Export with:
   module.exports = { pickMove };

State summary:
- state.players[playerIndex] is current player
- each player has hand (array of {rank,suit}) and books (array of ranks)
- state.deck.length is cards remaining
- legalActions is prevalidated list for current turn

Goal:
- maximize win rate across many games (1000+),
- prioritize completing books,
- then deny likely opponent books.
