# Lite Go Fish

Simple hot-seat Go Fish web app for two players on one computer.

## Run

- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- Use the Opponent toggle in the header to switch between Human and AI.
- Table talk keeps the latest moves in a scrollable list.

## Rules

- Ask for a rank you already hold.
- If the opponent has any of that rank, they hand them over and you ask again.
- If not, draw one card. If it matches, you go again. Otherwise the turn passes.
- Book a rank when you collect all four cards.
- The game ends when all 13 books are made.
